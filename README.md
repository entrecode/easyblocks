The React toolkit for building completely customised visual page builders.

It's focused on simplicity for end-users (no HTML/CSS) and flexibilty for developers (built as a framework).

## Main features

- **Embeddable**: Easyblocks editor is designed to be embeddedable into other products
- **Out-of-the-box visual building logic**: drag&drop, nested selections, inline rich text, multi-selection, styling fields (responsive), design tokens, history management, localisation, templates, dynamic data
- **Simple for end-users**. Not based on HTML/CSS but on [No-Code Components](https://docs.easyblocks.io/essentials/no-code-components).
- **Bring your own components and templates**. Easyblocks is built as a framework.You decide what components are available, their variants, styling options, simplicity levels, children components, constraints, etc.
- **[Bring your own data](https://docs.easyblocks.io/essentials/external-data)**. Connect any data source, fully control data fetching and data picker widget. The data can be dynamic.
- **Server-side rendering**. Fully compatible with modern frameworks like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/), but can also render to pure HTML/CSS. All the heavy lifting happens on the server - no browser rendering and layout shifts.

## Why?

If you need a custom text editor there are so many solutions available: Slate, Lexical, TinyMCE, CKEditor, etc. But if you need a custom page builder there's a huge chance you must build one from scratch. And it’s an awfully expensive and tedious process.

The goal behind Easyblocks is to make it possible to create truly state-of-the-art visual page building experiences in weeks instead of years, without compromising flexibility.

## How?

Easyblocks can handle a wide range of seemingly different visual experiences thanks to a very clear separation between what's common for all visual builders and what's custom and project-specific. The Easyblocks editor knows how to handle common visual builder logic (drag&drop, nested selections, inline rich text, responsive styling fields, etc), but at the same time doesn't know anything about project-specific things like your [components](https://docs.easyblocks.io/essentials/no-code-components), [data sources](https://docs.easyblocks.io/essentials/external-data) or [templates](https://docs.easyblocks.io/essentials/templates). Project-specific stuff can be defined with code using Easyblocks framework, which is based on a novel concept called [No-Code Components](https://docs.easyblocks.io/essentials/no-code-components).
